"""
SentimentSuite Summarizer Service - High-Performance Text Summarization API

This is the main FastAPI application that provides enterprise-grade text summarization
with advanced features including semantic chunking, intelligent caching, performance
monitoring, and comprehensive health checks.

Architecture Overview:
- Clean Architecture with SOLID principles and dependency injection
- Advanced semantic chunking using sentence embeddings and clustering  
- Optimized ML model with quantization and batch processing
- Enterprise patterns: Circuit Breaker, Retry, Cache-Aside
- Comprehensive observability with metrics and health checks
- Production-ready error handling and graceful degradation

Key Features:
- Semantic chunking for coherent summarization
- 3 quality levels: Fast, Balanced, Quality
- Intelligent caching with LRU and TTL
- Circuit breaker protection for resilience  
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Health checks for all system components
- Admin endpoints for cache management

Performance Characteristics:
- Cache hits: <100ms response time
- Cache misses: 1-15s depending on text length and quality
- Throughput: 10-100 requests/second (depending on caching)
- Memory usage: 2-8GB (depending on model and quantization)
